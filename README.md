# Karostartup_assign

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

-----------------

This project is a my assignment for the position of Flutter Developer at KaroStartup.

## IMP note

-------------------
- I was not able to find API for the data, therefore I used static values which is present in [Products.dart](https://github.com/darkling10/karostartup_assign/blob/master/lib/resources/products.dart)
- If we find an API for this, only this file is needed to be changed
